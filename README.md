# Webnasm

An [online](https://donno2048.github.io/webnasm) NASM assembly debugger.

Made because I needed to debug my [snake project](https://github.com/donno2048/snake) and hated every other assembly debugger.

There is a folder filled with [demos](./demos/), you can drag and drop any assembly file into the code editor and start debugging it (the snake code in the demos folder is outdated).

The debugger is powerful yet very plain and simple.
